	<h1>About this app</h1>

	<p>This is a personal finance application for managing your finances and tracking expenses.</p>

	<p>
		I Metodi Mladneovski am the sole creator of this project. I am doing this in order to learn
		NestJS and Svelte, however I have decided to build this application because I really need it
		to automate my finance and tracking of expenses.
